            <p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar">Wikipedia:</a> The guitar is a fretted musical
                instrument
                that typically has six strings. It is usually held flat against the
                player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while
                simultaneously
                pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual
                finger
                picks may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically,
                by means
                of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.</p>
            <p>The guitar is classified as a chordophone – meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched
                between
                two fixed points. Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut.
                Steel guitar
                strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States;[1] nylon strings
                came in
                the 1940s.[1] The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance
                guitar, and
                the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string
                instrument.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The modern word guitar, and its antecedents, has been applied to a wide variety of chordophones since
            classical
            times and as such causes confusion. The English word guitar, the German Gitarre, and the French guitare were
            all
            adopted from the Spanish guitarra, which comes from the Andalusian Arabic قيثارة (qīthārah)[6] and the Latin
            cithara, which in turn came from the Ancient Greek κιθάρα This Greek word may also come from the Persian
            word
            Sihtar.[7] Kithara appears in the Bible four times (1 Cor. 14:7, Rev. 5:8, 14:2 and 15:2), and is usually
            translated into English as harp.</p>
